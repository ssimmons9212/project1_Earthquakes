# Oklahoma Earthquakes

## Background

Oklahoma now has more earthquakes on a regular basis than California. Are they due to fracking?
In a few cases, yes, but in most cases no. Only a few of the over 2000 magnitude 3 and larger earthquakes since 2009 that have occurred in Oklahoma have been connected to hydraulic fracturing. 

The majority of earthquakes in Oklahoma are caused by the industrial practice​ known as "wastewater disposal". Wastewater disposal is a ​separate ​process in which fluid waste from oil and gas production is injected deep underground far below ground water or drinking water aquifers. In Oklahoma over 90% of the wastewater that is injected is a byproduct of oil extraction process and not waste frack fluid.

The purpose of this project is to prove that waste water disposal is the contributing factor to the earthquakes.

## Scope of Work
* Date range is from 2013 - 2018
* Earthquake recording of magnitude 2.5 or higher only
